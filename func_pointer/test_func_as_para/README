I did an experiment and found out that function itself could not be
 loaded as parameters

From terminal I got these:

(deeplearning) [chenhanxuan@idiospace test_func_as_para]$ g++ -g test.cpp
test.cpp: In function ‘double definite_integrals(double (*)(double), double, double, double)’:
test.cpp:14:36: error: expression cannot be used as a function
   result += delta * (&p_func)(count);
                                    ^
